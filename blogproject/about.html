                <p style="text-align:justify; ">When it comes to scuba diving in India, we often think about scuba diving in Andamans or Lakshadweep Islands. While scuba diving in the Andamans is beautiful; one rarely links Indian scuba diving to the mainland. So, we decided to change that and bring scuba diving right at your doorstep in mainland India and provide a whole new blue section of India for you to explore. Temple Adventures is a scuba diving center situated on the East Coast of India. It is mainland Indiaâ€™s first and largest dive school. Temple Adventures started scuba diving in India around ten years ago; continuing off the diving exploration by the Pondicherry Ashram. Temple Adventures, along with our sister dive centre off Chennai are PADI 5 Star Instructor Development Dive Centres that regularly conduct basic experience programmes, certified courses and even caters to divers who wish to follow their passion of becoming dive professionals. Temple Adventures has been associated with the Indian Defence forces and has regularly trained the Marine Police, Indian Coast guard. We have also trained Wildlife rangers in the Gulf of Mannar national park as well as upcoming marine biologists from Alagappa University with the help of our marine conservation department, Temple Reef Foundation.</p>
